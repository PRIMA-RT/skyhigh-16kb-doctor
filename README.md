## üì¢ Project Description

This plugin is built with Gradle Kotlin DSL and written entirely in Kotlin, making it easy to integrate and maintain within modern Android projects.
It analyzes your Android project to identify native libraries (.so files) that are not compatible with the 16KB alignment requirement. The plugin then generates a clear report with:

- Incompatible libraries
- 16 KB Alignment
- Helps with large multi-module projects
- Cover all the CPU types (x86, x86_64, arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a)
- Support JDK 17 For Running 

## ‚ö° Why use it?

- Saves hours of manual investigation
- Works as an alternative to custom Lint checks
- Automates verification of native library alignment during the build process


## üì¶ Installation

Add the plugin to your `build.gradle.kts`:

Make sure to add this in your Android application **entry module** (or app):

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("io.github.sparrow007.skyhigh.16kb-doctor") version "1.0.2"
}
```

### üõ† In Settings.gradle 
**MaveCentral** should be included in plugin Management repo

```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

## üîÅ Sync your project

After adding the dependency, click **"Sync Now"** in Android Studio or run the following command in your terminal to sync your project:


## üõ† Usage

After applying the plugin, run: with your app **entry module** name 

```
./gradlew :app:skyhighDoctor

```

### üöÄ Test dependencies fast using this project.

You can now directly test any new dependency in this project's **app module** without importing the full plugin into a large project.

Simply add the dependency you want to test in this project's app-level `build.gradle.kts`, then run:

```
./gradlew :app:runWithFreshReport
```

This command will build the app, generate a fresh report, and launch the app with the latest report.
